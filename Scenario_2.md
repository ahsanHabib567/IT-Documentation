## Place:
**Home, Banani Road 3 - Dhaka**
## Issue: 
**1 PC no Internet from Access Point**
## Reason:  
**The PC was connected via Ethernet cable to an access point router. The access point is also connected via an Ethernet cable to another TP-Link access point router. The problem was that the TP-Link access point wasn't getting internet access from the main router. Perhaps there was a cable-related issue or a deadlock on the TP-Link access point.**
## Approach:  
**1. Plugged out and in the cable of the main router that was connected to the TP-Link access point. [Solved].**
