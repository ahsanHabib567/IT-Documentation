## Place:
**Hotel Zakaria International - Dhaka**
## Issue: 
**No internet on the 3rd floor in one Router, and internet
blackout at the reception site router.**
## Reason:  
**There was an adapter issue with the Altai router on
3rd floor. The router wasnâ€™t getting power. And on the reception
site, maybe a restart of the network stack by them caused the
problem.**
## Approach:  
**1. Changed the Adapter. [Solved]  
2. Plug out and in all the necessary cables, and again restarted
the network stack. [Solved].**
