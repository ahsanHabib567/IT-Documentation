#Place:
Hotel Zakaria International
##Issue: 
No internet on 3rd floor in one Router and internet
blackout at the reception site router.
##Reason: 
There was an adapter issue of the Altai router on
3rd floor. Router wasnâ€™t getting power. And on the reception
site, maybe a restart of the network stack by them caused the
problem.
##Approach:
1. Changed the Adapter. [Solved]
2. Plug out and in all the necessary cables, and again restarted
the network stack. [Solved].
