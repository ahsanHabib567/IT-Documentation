# IT-Documentation
This repo is meant to be the central hub of all the scenarios, issues and the best approaches to solve them I encounter in my daily working life as an IT and Networking person.

Documentation plays a crucial role in the IT and Networking do-
main. We all encounter numerous problems in our working lives in
IT. We may find solutions to some of these problems at the time,
but not others. If proper documentation is available about these
scenarios, we can review them at any time and gain insights to solve
new problems. This is why documentation is necessary.
We can lay out the documentation stating the Problem, how it oc-
curs, and Measures taken to solve that problem.
